> This is the curriculum overview for the three-project rebuild course, copied into this repository so links from [rebuild/](rebuild/README.md) resolve. The three parts live on GitHub as [elirc/gitjira](https://github.com/elirc/gitjira), [elirc/stockade](https://github.com/elirc/stockade), and [elirc/relay](https://github.com/elirc/relay), each under `rebuild/`.

# The rebuild curriculum: three systems, one course

Three local learning projects live in this repository, built on 1 October 2026
through Astra/Sol adversarial builds and expanded into a junior-to-senior
curriculum for CRUD web application development. Each asks one sharp question,
answers it with a runnable system, and proves the answer with tests you can
read, run, and break.

**Work them in this order.** Each project assumes the discipline the previous
one taught.

| # | Project | Central question | Core mechanisms |
|---|---------|------------------|-----------------|
| 1 | [gitjira-rebuild](https://github.com/elirc/gitjira/blob/main/rebuild/README.md) | Can two editors silently lose each other's work? | Optimistic concurrency (version compare-and-swap), authorization inside the transaction, atomic mutation+activity, browser request-identity tokens |
| 2 | [stockade-rebuild](https://github.com/elirc/stockade/blob/main/rebuild/README.md) | Can two buyers be promised the same physical unit? | Inventory conservation (`onHand ≥ reserved ≥ 0`), idempotent checkout keys with intent fingerprints, two-process contention evidence, shared-cookie tab identity |
| 3 | [relay-rebuild](rebuild/README.md) | Can a workflow recover when the outside world accepted an effect the worker never checkpointed? | Immutable published versions, lease fencing, durable checkpoints, provider idempotency keys, the effect/checkpoint crash window |

## The thread that connects them

Every project is about giving each piece of async work an **owner with the
right lifetime**:

- GitJira: a row **version** owns what a write may replace; a request **token**
  owns what a response may update. Neither substitutes for the other.
- Stockade: a checkout **key** owns a purchase intent across lost responses,
  reloads, and tabs; a product **version** owns an operator adjustment; the
  **displayed account** owns a tab's writes even though tabs share cookies.
- Relay: a run **request key**, a worker **lease token**, and a provider
  **effect key** have three different lifetimes, and confusing any two of them
  breaks a different guarantee.

The deliberate boundary between projects 2 and 3: **Stockade can atomically
mutate its simulated order and inventory in one transaction. Relay
deliberately cannot** — its provider receipts live in a separate store, so no
transaction can span effect and checkpoint. That is why Relay needs a
different recovery contract (stable idempotency keys and a cooperating durable
provider) rather than a bigger transaction. Understanding why the Stockade
answer stops working at the Relay boundary is the single most important
takeaway of the course.

## How each project is organized

All three follow the same conventions:

- `README.md` — run, explore, verify; honest scope limits.
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` / `CONTRACT.md` — the boundaries and the API promises.
- `journal/READ-ME-FIRST.txt` — the factual build retrospective: real
  disagreements, real bugs, real fixes.
- `journal/VERIFICATION.md` + `journal/evidence/` — exact final results at
  their actual strength, with raw output and screenshots. Historical record;
  later additions are not written into it.
- `journal/reviews/` — each agent's explicit findings.
- `journal/diffs/` — the review findings reconstructed as study-able diffs
  (labeled reconstructions; pre-fix source was not preserved).
- Learning layer — gitjira has `CODE-TOUR.md` + `EXERCISES.md`; stockade and
  relay have `journal/LEARNING-PATH.md`, `USER-STORY-WALKTHROUGHS.md`
  (fictional, labeled as such), `ARCHITECTURE-CLINIC.md`, and
  `PRACTICE-WORKBOOK.md` with labs and answer guides.
- Verification is always the same three commands from the project folder:
  `npm run check`, `npm test`, `npm run test:browser`. Each project carries a
  `.github/workflows/ci.yml` that runs them when pushed as its own repository.

## Working method (applies to every exercise)

1. **Predict first.** Write down what you expect before reading the code or
   running the test. The learning is in the gap.
2. **Evidence at its actual strength.** "12 tests pass" and "lost updates are
   impossible" are different claims; say which one you have.
3. When using builder/reviewer/verifier agents: the builder gives two viable
   designs and the conditions under which its preferred one is wrong; the
   reviewer gives a concrete failure history (input, observed result, violated
   promise), never "improve validation"; the verifier turns each accepted
   objection into a test that fails before the fix. Rotate roles between
   exercises.
4. One boundary change at a time, so disagreements have a clear object.

## Suggested path through the course

1. **GitJira** — take the [code tour](https://github.com/elirc/gitjira/blob/main/rebuild/CODE-TOUR.md), then
   [exercises](https://github.com/elirc/gitjira/blob/main/rebuild/EXERCISES.md) Tier 1 (break the guarantees) and
   at least two Tier 2 extensions.
2. **Stockade** — follow its
   [learning path](https://github.com/elirc/stockade/blob/main/rebuild/journal/LEARNING-PATH.md); the contention
   lab and the two-tab identity lab are the heart of it.
3. **Relay** — follow its
   [learning path](rebuild/journal/LEARNING-PATH.md); draw the
   two-database crash timeline before running the durability suite.
4. **Boundary-moving capstones** (pick one per project): GitJira → PostgreSQL
   port or real auth; Stockade → partial refunds or a migration; Relay →
   persisted wait deadlines or the local webhook adapter.

Everything runs locally on this laptop: Node 22.16+, Express, `node:sqlite`,
Playwright Chromium. No external service is contacted by any project.
